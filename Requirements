 1. Evolution of Requirements

Definition: Requirements are what the software should do, and they often evolve over time due to business changes, user feedback, or technical constraints.

Stages of Evolution:

| Stage                 | Explanation                                           | Example                                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Elicitation       | Gathering requirements from stakeholders              | Bank wants “mobile fund transfer.”                                   |
| Analysis          | Understand, prioritize, and check feasibility         | Decide which payment modes to support first: UPI, card, net banking. |
| Specification     | Document requirements formally (SRS)                  | “Fund transfer limit = ₹1,00,000/day.”                               |
| Validation        | Ensure requirements are complete, clear, and testable | Testable: “App must send OTP within 5 seconds.”                      |
| Change Management | Update requirements due to feedback or changes        | RBI changes rules → app needs updated interest calculation.          |

Real-Time Example:

 WhatsApp originally allowed text messaging only.
 Later, requirements evolved → voice messages, video calls, group calls, status feature were added.

 2. Who Provides the Requirements?

Requirements come from multiple stakeholders:

| Stakeholder                     | Example / Role                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Business / Client           | Defines what software should achieve. Example: Bank wants QR code payments. |
| End Users                   | Provide usability needs. Example: Users want dark mode in WhatsApp.     |
| Regulatory Bodies           | Legal / compliance requirements. Example: RBI rules for fund transfers.     |

---

 3. Challenges in Requirement Gathering

1. Unclear Requirements – Stakeholders don’t know exactly what they want.

    Example: “Make login secure” → too vague.

2. Changing Requirements – Mid-project changes.

    Example: Add UPI payments after initial release.

3. Communication Gaps – Developers misunderstand business needs.

    Example: Bank wants 2FA → dev implements only password.

4. Conflicting Requirements – Different stakeholders want opposite things.

    Example: Users want quick login, security team wants multiple verifications.

5. Incomplete Requirements – Missing details.

    Example: SRS doesn’t specify daily transfer limit.

6. Technical Feasibility – Some ideas may be impossible to implement.

    Example: Real-time fraud detection may need extra servers and resources.

---

 4. Why Do We Need Good Requirements?

Good requirements are essential because:

1. Provide clear direction → developers know exactly what to build.

    Example: “Send OTP within 5 seconds” is clear.

2. Reduce costs → prevent expensive fixes later.

    Example: Fixing fund transfer bug after release is costly.

3. Better planning → estimate resources and time accurately.

4. Enable testing → testers can design test cases from clear requirements.

 5. Characteristics of Good Requirements

| Characteristic            | Meaning                    | Example                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Correct               | Matches stakeholder needs  | OTP must reach in 5 sec                              |
| Unambiguous           | Only one interpretation    | Daily fund transfer limit = ₹1,00,000                |
| Complete              | Covers all functionality   | Login, 2FA, fund transfer, notifications             |
| Consistent            | No conflicts               | Security and usability requirements don’t contradict |
| Verifiable / Testable | Can be tested              | “App must allow 10 simultaneous group calls”         |
| Traceable             | Can track to source        | Requirement linked to business goal                  |
| Understandable        | Clear for all stakeholders | Written in simple language                           |

 6. Impact of Bad Requirements

| Problem                 | Impact / Example                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vague / Ambiguous   | Wrong implementation. Example: “Make voice notes better” → different developers interpret differently |
| Incomplete          | Missing functionality → user complaints                                                               |
| Conflicting         | Delays, disagreements between teams                                                                   |
| Unrealistic         | Deadlines missed, frustrated devs                                                                     |
| Unverifiable        | Testers cannot validate → defects go unnoticed                                                        |
| Constantly Changing | Scope creep, increased cost                                                                           |

Real-Time Example (WhatsApp):

 Requirement: “Improve media sharing.”
 Bad requirement → unclear which media (images, videos, docs?), no size limits → developers may implement only images → user complaints.

# **1. Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements**

### **A. Functional Requirements (FR)**

* **Definition:** Describe **what the system should do** (features and behavior).
* **Examples:**

  * WhatsApp: Send messages, voice notes, video calls.
  * Banking App: Fund transfer, account balance check, bill payment.

**Real-Time Example:**

* WhatsApp FR: “User can send a message to a contact.”
* Banking FR: “User can transfer ₹1,00,000 per day via UPI.”

---

### **B. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**

* **Definition:** Describe **how the system should behave**, i.e., quality attributes.
* **Focus:** Performance, reliability, usability, security, scalability.

| Category    | WhatsApp Example          | Banking App Example                |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Performance | Messages delivered in <2s | Fund transfer processed <5s        |
| Security    | End-to-end encryption     | OTP & 2FA for login & transactions |
| Usability   | Simple UI                 | Easy navigation for fund transfer  |
| Reliability | 99.9% uptime              | App available 24/7                 |
| Scalability | Millions of users         | Handle peak loads on salary day    |

---

# **2. Stable vs Volatile Requirements**

| Type         | Definition                                                                       | Example                                                                             |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stable**   | Core features that **rarely change**                                             | WhatsApp: Sending messages; Banking App: Fund transfer, login                       |
| **Volatile** | Features that **frequently change** due to trends, user feedback, or regulations | WhatsApp: Dark mode, emoji reactions; Banking App: UI redesign, new RBI regulations |

**Key Point:**

* Stable → foundation of the app, must always work correctly.
* Volatile → need flexible design to adapt quickly.

# **4. Requirements Change**

**Definition:**

* Modifying or adding requirements **during the software lifecycle**.

**Reasons:**

* New stakeholder needs
* Regulatory changes
* Technology upgrades
* Bug fixes or performance issues

**Example:**

* Banking App initially supports only UPI. Later, a **requirement change** adds **credit card payments**.
