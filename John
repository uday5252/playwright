Problem Statement

John is preparing for an exam. He has a list of questions, and each question carries certain marks.
He can attempt a **continuous sequence of questions** (subarray), but there is one restriction:

* John **cannot attempt two questions that have the same marks** within his chosen sequence.

Your task is to help John find the **maximum total marks** he can obtain by attempting such a valid sequence of questions.


Input Format

* The first line contains an integer `N`, the number of questions.
* The second line contains `N` integers, where the `i-th` integer represents the marks of the `i-th` question.


Output Format

* Print a single integer — the maximum marks John can obtain.
